# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Internship Project (Week 1)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the NSP Nexus internship (Week 1).  
The goal is to build a **Machine Learning model** that classifies iris flowers into 3 species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

We used the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to predict the species based on flower measurements (sepal and petal length & width).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy – for data handling
- matplotlib, seaborn – for visualization
- sklearn – for ML model building
- GitHub – for code submission

---

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. **Loaded** the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`
2. **Explored & visualized** the dataset
3. **Split** data into training and test sets using `train_test_split`
4. **Trained** a model using `KNeighborsClassifier`
5. **Evaluated** the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix
6. **Visualized** results using seaborn heatmap

---

## ✅ Model Accuracy
The KNN model achieved approximately **(your actual accuracy here, e.g., 96%)** on the test dataset.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Run each cell in order
3. Output and graphs will be displayed below each block
